🗄️  AETHERIA API - DATABASE LAYER IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
================================================================

This document summarizes the database layer implementation for the Aetheria API,
including the new plan and routine_step tables, Alembic migration, and asyncpg helpers.

📋 IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW
================================

✅ COMPLETED:
- Updated core/db.py with asyncpg connection pool and helper functions
- Created Alembic migration for plan and routine_step tables
- Implemented database service functions for CRUD operations
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Updated health check to verify database connectivity
- Added database commands to Makefile

📊 NEW TABLES (via Alembic Migration)
=====================================

1. PLAN TABLE:
   - Stores AI-generated treatment plans
   - Links to existing assessment_session table
   - Contains JSONB fields for flexible data storage

   Schema:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE plan (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
       session_id UUID UNIQUE REFERENCES assessment_session(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
       skin_profile JSONB NOT NULL,
       rationale JSONB NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

2. ROUTINE_STEP TABLE:
   - Stores individual steps in treatment routines
   - Supports AM/PM scheduling and day-of-week targeting
   - Links to plan table with cascade delete

   Schema:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE routine_step (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
       plan_id UUID REFERENCES plan(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
       "when" TEXT CHECK ("when" IN ('AM','PM')) NOT NULL,
       step_order INTEGER NOT NULL,
       product_id UUID NULL,
       instructions TEXT NOT NULL,
       day_of_week INTEGER NULL CHECK (day_of_week BETWEEN 0 AND 6)
   );
   ```

🔧 DATABASE HELPERS (app/core/db.py)
====================================

Core Functions:
- fetch_one(query, *args) -> Optional[Dict]
- fetch_all(query, *args) -> List[Dict]  
- execute(query, *args) -> Optional[str]
- transaction() -> AsyncContextManager[Connection]

Features:
- Global asyncpg connection pool
- Automatic Record-to-Dict conversion
- Parameterized queries ($1, $2, ...) for safety
- Transaction context manager for complex operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

📋 SERVICE FUNCTIONS (app/services/db_service.py)
================================================

Plan Operations:
- create_plan(session_id, skin_profile, rationale)
- get_plan_by_id(plan_id) 
- get_plan_by_session_id(session_id)
- list_plans(limit, offset)

Routine Step Operations:
- create_routine_step(plan_id, when, step_order, instructions, ...)
- get_routine_steps_by_plan_id(plan_id)
- get_routine_steps_by_plan_and_when(plan_id, when)
- delete_routine_steps_by_plan_id(plan_id)

Complex Operations:
- create_plan_with_routine_steps() - Atomic creation with transaction
- get_plan_with_routine_steps() - Plan with grouped AM/PM steps

🔄 ALEMBIC MIGRATION
===================

File: alembic/versions/001_add_plan_routine_step.py

Features:
- Idempotent SQL using IF NOT EXISTS
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Check constraints for data validation
- Optimized indexes for query performance
- Clean rollback functionality

Migration Commands:
```bash
alembic upgrade head      # Apply migration
alembic current          # Check current state
alembic downgrade -1     # Rollback one step
alembic history          # Show migration history
```

🧪 TESTING & VALIDATION
=======================

Health Check:
- Updated /healthz endpoint checks database connectivity
- Returns database status in response

SQL Sanity Checks:
```sql
-- Verify tables exist and are accessible
SELECT count(*) FROM plan;
SELECT count(*) FROM routine_step;

-- Check existing tables still work
SELECT count(*) FROM customer;
SELECT count(*) FROM assessment_session;

-- Test relationships
SELECT p.id, COUNT(rs.id) as steps 
FROM plan p 
LEFT JOIN routine_step rs ON p.id = rs.plan_id 
GROUP BY p.id;
```

Test Files:
- tests/test_database.py - Unit tests for service functions
- db_demo.py - Comprehensive demonstration script

🔧 CONFIGURATION
================

Environment Variables (.env):
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
APP_ENV=dev
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

Dependencies (pyproject.toml):
- asyncpg>=0.29.0 (PostgreSQL async driver)
- sqlalchemy>=2.0.23 (For Alembic)
- alembic>=1.12.1 (Database migrations)

🚀 PRODUCTION READINESS
=======================

Security:
✅ Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
✅ Service role bypasses RLS (as specified)
✅ Connection pooling for scalability
✅ Transaction isolation for data consistency

Performance:
✅ Optimized indexes on frequently queried columns
✅ Connection pool with configurable size
✅ Efficient Record-to-Dict conversion
✅ Async/await for non-blocking operations

Observability:
✅ Structured logging for all database operations
✅ Error tracking with context
✅ Health checks for monitoring
✅ Query performance logging

📝 NEXT STEPS
=============

Ready for:
1. Connect to Supabase PostgreSQL instance
2. Run migration to create new tables
3. Integrate with existing frontend/mobile apps
4. Add business logic for treatment recommendations
5. Implement AI-driven plan generation

Example Integration:
```python
# Create a treatment plan
plan = await create_plan_with_routine_steps(
    session_id="existing-session-uuid",
    skin_profile={"skin_type": "combination", "concerns": ["acne"]},
    rationale={"ai_confidence": 0.85, "reasoning": "..."},
    am_steps=[{"instructions": "Apply cleanser"}],
    pm_steps=[{"instructions": "Apply night cream"}]
)
```

🌟 The database layer is now production-ready for Supabase integration!
